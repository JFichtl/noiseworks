# Noiseworks Digital Audio Effects Repository
## Open source digital sound effects based on JACK audio connection kit.

This repository is intended to provide both working examples of simple digital audio effects and simple, readable code that can be used to learn just how these things work. Every single effect should consist of one or two functions or classes with the algorithms spelled out in a clear, concise way. Documentation will be expanded in the future to provide more in-depth explanation of basic digital effects concepts such as: 

* ring buffers for delaying signals
* mixing signals
* low frequency oscilators for modulation effects
* overlap save/add algorithms
* fourier transform based filtering and processing
* z-domain parametric filters and difference equations.
* convolution and filter-bank artificial reverberation
* impulse response cabinet emulation
